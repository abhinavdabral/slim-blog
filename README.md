# Slim Blog

Simple Slim Framework based blogging platform. It's intended to generate flat HTML files, that should really help in making the site super-fast and prevent any database calls from client side, whatesoever (with an exception of searches, if implemented).

## ToDo
Everything pretty much. At this point it's just barebones. Basic intended functionality is still incomplete.

- Add Categories
- User Module with ACL
- Disable Sign Up (make it optional)
- Ability to Generate HTML pages (based on theme)
- A lot more.
